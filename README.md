# Fake-News-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

ABSTRACT:- The rapid growth of online information has increased the spread of misleading and deceptive content across digital platforms, making fake news detection a critical research challenge. This study focuses on identifying fake news using machine learning techniques applied to the FakeNewsNet dataset, which contains 23,196 news titles with their corresponding publishing source domains, tweet counts, and ground-truth labels. The objective of this research is to analyze patterns between real and fake news and build a prediction model capable of distinguishing them accurately based solely on textual features. Data preprocessing involved extensive text cleaning including tokenization, lemmatization, stop-word removal, and noise filtering. Exploratory data analysis revealed insightful trends across news domains and audience engagement metrics, showing significant disparities in tweet frequency and source credibility between authentic and fabricated news articles. Word cloud representations further highlighted distinctive keyword distributions in real versus fake content. After preprocessing, news titles were converted into numerical sequences using a Tokenizer and fed into a deep learning LSTM model for classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of recurrent neural network-based text modelling in capturing contextual information from short textual inputs. Results indicate that the proposed approach exhibits promising accuracy in detecting fake news and can serve as a foundation for building automated misinformation monitoring systems. Overall, this study highlights the importance of combining natural language processing with deep learning techniques to address the ongoing challenge of fake news proliferation in modern digital communication ecosystems.
